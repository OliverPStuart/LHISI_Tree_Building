# Building LHISI trees
This repository contains all the code used to build the tree for placing *Dryococelus australis* in phylogenetic context for the genome assembly paper ([Stuart et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/15/6/evad104/7190050)). Some config files are missing. This is just here for posterity, not re-use.
